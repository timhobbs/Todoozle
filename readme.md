Todoozle!
=========

Todoozle! is the obligatory "todo" app created in backbone.js and utilizing ASP.NET WebAPI for the server-side technology.

Why "Todoozle!"
---------------
Well, cause it sounds silly, so I figured, "why not?" **Then** I googled and saw there is an actual OSX app with the same name. Are you kidding me? Oh well, I am not selling anything, so hopefully I don't make anyone upset. I am sure I'll hear from them if I do...

Why another todo app?
---------------------
Well, I think it is the _law_? Seriously though, it is an easy way to get started in a well-known domain.

How do I use it?
----------------
The easiest way to get started is to open the solution file up in Visual Studio and hit F5. If you wan to get into the nuts and bolts of things, you can setup the site to run in IIS or IIS Express. 

If you want to edit the application javascript, you'll either need to muck about in the transpiled js or you'll want to have some way to edit the Coffeescript. The easiest way in the VS environment is to download the free Mindscape Web Workbench extension.

I am also thinking about pushing it to AppHarbor, but I haven't yet done so.

What's in the box?
------------------
All the latest buzzwords:
* Twitter Bootstrap
* Font Awesome
* jQuery
* Backbone.js
* Underscore.js
* Handlebars.js
* jQuery Cookie plugin
* Coffeescript

How does it work?
-----------------
Really? You don't know whow to use a todo app? Well then, here goes:

1. You enter a todo - something you want "to do"
2. You do the todo task that you wanted to do
3. You mark the todo as complete by checking the checkbox

Alternatively, you can also:
* Edit a todo
* Delete a todo
* Undo marking the todo as complete - in case you get a little ahead of yourself

Future updates
--------------
* Ability to allow multiple users via user creation/authentication
* Ability for authenticated users to be able to view/edit/activate deleted todos
